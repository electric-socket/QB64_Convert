# QB64_Convert
This is a program to convert QB64 Phoenix Edition programs which have used the (deprecated) $NOPREFIX metacommand so that they don't have to use _ before new keywords that normally require that prefix.

# How to use
Run or compile the program QB64_convert, when presented with the file dialog box, give the name of the existing basic language program that uses QB64 Phoenix Edition features, then in the second file dialog box, give the file name to save to, and this program will translate all Phoenix Edition keywords that require a leading _ but don't have it.
